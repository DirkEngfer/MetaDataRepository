Source for the metadata repository (MDR):
   test.ttl

Source for database query code:
   test.rq

To run the process i.e. pull out needed metadata from the MDR:
  At the Linux terminal execute the command "sh run.sh".

Outputs by the above shell script:
  - SDTM_CM_variables_sort_order.txt
  - SDTM_CM_variables.txt

Further step(s):
  Write a SAS program that reads in the above generated .txt metadata (e.g. via INFILE and INPUT statement) to map data for SDTM or other standardized purposes.
