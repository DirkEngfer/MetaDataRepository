In my eyes succeeding in the automation of chaining SDTM / ADaM /TFL etc requires all metadata content upfront that goes with the
define.xml. But this is not sufficient, we need more. With my example pathway I hope to demonstrate how to setup useful metadata beyond of what is inside Define.xml.
It is my conviction to not handle SAS program statements with the MDR because I want to describe properties of variables, datasets, codelists and the like.
The focus is on handling what the data item is about, not on what we can do with it.
Specification of standard program logic may be approached with other routines/techniques.
